# Solar-System-Calculator
The Solar System Calculator plugin, was created to enable solar system engineers and to enthusiasts to easily calculated the Watts/Hour, Total Watts Hour, Inverter size, Solar Panel size, Charge Controller, Battery size for a group or single selected electrical appliance:

Looking at the plugin structure, I've implemented:

    Admin Section:
        Appliance management (add/edit/delete)
        User list view
        Calculations list
        Messaging system

    Public Section:
        Calculator interface with appliance selection
        Calculation logic for solar system requirements
        Email notification system
        Product recommendations

    Database Structure:
        Tables for appliances
        Tables for calculation results
        Default data population on activation

The plugin is fully functional from a code perspective. It includes all the features listed above:

    Admin can manage appliances
    Users can select appliances and input usage hours
    The system calculates inverter size, solar panel size, battery capacity, and charge controller specs
    Results are stored and sent via email
    Admin can view all calculations and send messages to users
There is room for improvement. Let us know which feature you will like to see in the plugin and our development team will take consider it and if aacepted it will be adopted in our next update.
